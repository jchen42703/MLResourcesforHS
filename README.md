# Machine Learning Resources 
## Introduction
Machine learning is no joke and there’s a ton of higher level mathematics involved. However, it’s entirely doable for anyone willing to put the time and dedication into it. I recommend that you read through the entirety of this resource before actually starting anything and don’t be afraid to ask questions! <br>
Also, note that if you find any resources that you feel are extremely helpful, please open up a pull request/issue.

## General Tips 
When you start to code, I highly recommend that you ask for someone to review your code on a consistent basis depending on the difficulty of the issue. It will save a lot of time.  Also, note that the hard part is always preprocessing the data and physically setting the hyperparameters/configuring the architecture of the NN/machine learning pipelines. The nuances with this process comes with experience, exposure, and a lot of failure. <br>
I know that there’s a lot of resources and stuff to go over, but here’s what I recommend doing:
* As you’re learning about the theory and mathematics, refer back to the code implementations to see how it really works. Don’t burn yourself out in the beginning. Take 5-10 minute breaks in between sessions and try to mix up your work (i.e. an hour of paper writing, then an hour of education, then an hour of coding/implementation, an hour of review, paper reading, and education and repeat). 
* If you feel like you’re losing motivation,  you’re tired, or stumped, take a 1-2 day break and come back with a fresh mind.
* Familiarize yourself with the data science/DL packages; you’d be surprised at how insanely good numpy, keras, and sklearn are. 
* Familiarize yourself with your data. In machine learning, getting the data right and having enough data is 75% of the process. 
Functions + OOP = importante

## Papers
You need to read papers on your field. Be very knowledgeable about your field because it’s useful for answering tough questions from your judges and it will provide a blueprint for what you need to do in your own implementations.
When you’re reading your papers, read them with purpose and ask questions while you read it. The reason is that you will end up wasting a lot of time focusing on unnecessary things. 
* i.e. What does this mean? How can I apply this? Where else is this used? What is a common practice? Why did someone use this method? Etc.
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHTOI0KtZnU) that guides you to reading papers [MUST WATCH]
* Be very familiar with the notation, especially for machine learning papers or you’re gonna go through hell.  

## Education and Theory
### General
* http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
	* You might not have time for all of it, but go over the main chapters (2, 3,5,6, 9, 11, 12).
You don’t need to fully understand everything, but you’ll know that you have gaps in your knowledge if you don’t understand the code implementations of the “From Scratch Repositories.” If your project is on unsupervised learning, then go over the GAN chapters (read the entire book).
* https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-explained
Provides great foundation for DL

### CNNs
* For image data, just know how it works, such as how they’re related to matrices, how preprocessing procedures affect their quality/values, and how to adapt your pipeline to your specific dataset (i.e. 1 channel v. 3 channels).

## Programming
Links to documentation; some documentation is confusing and convoluted, so I recommend asking someone (i.e. from a ML discord) for clarification. For understanding the application of the packages, it’s best to look at code examples and read papers in your field.
